We are all stuck inside (which is necessary) but emotions and anxiety are probably a little higher than normal. None of us quite know what is going to happen next and that can be unsettling üòï\n\nMindful Eating is a technique that can be used to help gain control of your eating and help you cope with your emotions. It's a way of paying attention to your actions and experiences before, during and after eating food ‚ö†Ô∏è Mindful Eating Tips:\nüîπSpend a moment or two to think about each meal or snack before you eat. Take a few deep breaths and visualise the food.\nüîπTake your time, chew each mouthful thoroughly. Really appreciating the taste and texture of each bite.\nüîπTry to eat with others at set times and at set places ie. a table or breakfast bar.\nüîπStop when you are full. This isn't as easy as it sounds but taking the time to notice how you feel throughout your meal will help you better understand your bodies cues.\nüîπEnjoy your food and try to eat healthful foods most of the time. \n#mindfulness #mindfuleating #mindfuleatingtips #selflove #selfcare #hungercues #nutritionaltherapy #healthylifestyle #personalisednutrition #rebalancingyou"}}]}}},{"node":{"thumbnail_src":"https://instagram.flhr3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.18.1080.1080a/s640x640/97057159_2681011402131039_2612001364269754546_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.flhr3-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=nSvGqGcBko8AX92Lpw1&oh=6d28ded2022d0b68cd08b6d296d6995f&oe=5EEC51F9","shortcode":"CAC3PjAJHbo","edge_media_to_caption":{"edges":[{"node":{"text":"This is one of my favourite things to eat!
