**Mindful Eating** is a technique that can be used to help gain control of your eating and help you cope with your emotions. It's a way of paying attention to your actions and experiences before, during and after eating food. Mindful eating leads to better intentional food choices and can help reduce unhealthy eating habits [<sup>1</sup>](#ref1).

It's especially hard for many of us at the moment. We've been stuck inside for ages and that has become the new normal but now as restrictions start to ease emotions and anxiety are probably a little higher than normal. None of us quite know what is going to happen next and that can be unsettling.


I saw this picture and thought how true it is! However, I also thought how difficult it is to tune into how hungry you really are.  It's all too easy to fall into a pattern of eating when we aren't truly hungry.

Sometimes we eat out of habit or fear of missing out, often without much thought at all. Things like time of day, boredom or sometimes, someone you're with is eating so you end up eating too.

The other thing that no one seems to consider, is the importance of taking time to enjoy the food you are eating. Do so, slowly making sure you are chewing each mouthful properly. This is important for optimal digestion and absorption of nutrients.

It can be hard to even notice that it's an issue but if any of the above resonates with you, try the helpful tips below.

Putting it into practice: [<sup>2</sup>](#ref2)
- Spend a moment or two to think about each meal or snack before you eat. Take a few deep breaths and visualise the food.
- Take your time, chew each mouthful thoroughly. Really appreciating the taste and texture of each bite.
- Try to eat with others at set times and at set places ie. a table or breakfast bar.
- Pause often, put your utensils down between mouthfuls.
- Stop when you are full. This isn't as easy as it sounds but taking the time to notice how you feel throughout your meal will help you better understand your bodies cues.
- Enjoy your food and try to eat healthful foods most of the time.

Finally, don't be too hard on yourself. Our relationship with food is complex, eating habits are hard to change. Start slowly, and remember that every day is a new day and like anything, mindful eating gets easier and feels more natural with practice [<sup>1</sup>](#ref1) [<sup>3</sup>](#ref3).
