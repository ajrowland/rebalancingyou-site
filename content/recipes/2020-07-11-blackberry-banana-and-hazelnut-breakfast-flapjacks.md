Whilst I wouldn't encourage eating on the go I'd certainly recommend taking one of these along to eat when you get to where you are going! The oats are a good source of fibre important for a healthy gut and diverse microbiome.

They are also a slow release carbohydrate which is important to help sustain energy and keep blood sugars balanced. The nuts and seeds are a great source of protein and healthy fats as well as containing a wealth of minerals, vitamins and antioxidants important for over all health.

They also happen to be suitable for vegans and are gluten and dairy free.
