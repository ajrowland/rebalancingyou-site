  text:
    - Apple pie – replace the carrot, pear and cranberries with grated apple and raisins, add a heaped teaspoon of ground almonds instead of nuts. Then top with chopped pecans and a little maple syrup if required.
    - Nutty chocolate banana - Leave out the carrot and pear and just make the base mixture top with sliced banana, hazelnuts and chocolate chips.
