  text:
    - Use blueberries instead of raspberries, or swap strawberries for pineapple
    - The base recipe can be adapted to suit your dietary requirements by swapping out the regular flour for gluten free versions. I like to use oat flour (whizzed up oats in a blender) and then add ground almonds and flax seeds. This adds fibre and some healthy fats too which will your gut will love! To make them dairy free simple use oat, coconut or almond milk.
