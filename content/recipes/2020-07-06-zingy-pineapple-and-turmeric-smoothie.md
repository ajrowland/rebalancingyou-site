introduction: "This refreshing immune supportive smoothie is packed with valuable nutrients. The pineapple, ginger and turmeric provide vitamin C and manganese crucial for brain health."
ingredients:
  - 250g chopped frozen or fresh pineapple (I like frozen as it makes it lovely and cold)
  - 1cm cube of fresh turmeric, peeled or 1 tsp ground turmeric
  - A thumb sized piece of fresh ginger peeled or ½ tsp ground ginger
  - 250ml coconut milk from a carton not a can milk
  - 1 heaped tsp coconut oil
  - 1 tbsp of chia seeds
  - Juice of half a lime
method:
  - Put all the ingredients into a blender (I use a Ninja) and blend until smooth.
  - Serve straight away with a piece of fresh pineapple to garnish.

Whilst the chia seeds add protein to keep us full, gut loving fibre to support digestion and omega 3 fatty acids which can help with inflammation.

Best of all, the coconut milk and oil give it ‘Pina Colada’ vibes!
