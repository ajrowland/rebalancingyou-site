  - Salt & pepper to taste.
method:
  - Finely slice the onions and radish, then chop the tomatoes and cucumbers into small cubes, add to a bowl.
  - Chop the green chill (rub a little oil on your fingers before to stop the heat from the chilli absorbing into your skin) add it to the rest of the mixture with the coriander and gently combine.

  - Serve with extra lemon wedges to adjust taste.

    - If you find raw onions too strong, soak the sliced onion in cold water for 15 minutes before adding to the salad.
