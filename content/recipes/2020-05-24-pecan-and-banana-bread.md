You can use different nuts or add some chopped dark chocolate. It's not very sweet so if you prefer sweeter you can add more honey. It will last for around 4-5 days in an airtight container or the fridge but I like to slice and freeze it. This make it last for ages and I just get a piece out as and when I feel like.  My favorite way to eat it is toasted with some almond butter.
